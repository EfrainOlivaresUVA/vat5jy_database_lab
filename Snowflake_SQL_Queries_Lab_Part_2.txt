SELECT course_id, course_name
FROM vat5jy_courses_erd
WHERE ACTIVE_COURSE_FLAG = 'TRUE'

--2 Which courses were included in the program, but are no longer active? Include the course mnemonic and course name for each.

--5 Are there any courses with no learning outcomes? If so, provide their mnemonics and names.
SELECT c.course_id, c.course_name
FROM vat5jy_courses_erd c
LEFT JOIN vat5jy_learning_outcomes_erd l
ON c.course_id = l.course_id
WHERE l.course_id IS NULL;

--6 Which courses include SQL as a learning outcome? Include the learning outcome descriptions, course mnemonics, and course names in your solution.
SELECT l.course_id, c.course_name, l.learning_outcome
FROM vat5jy_learning_outcomes_erd l
INNER JOIN vat5jy_courses_erd c
ON c.course_id = l.course_id
WHERE l.learning_outcome like '%SQL%'

GROUP BY c.term_ID, i.instructor_name
ORDER BY c.term_ID, i.instructor_name

--10a Which courses had more than one instructor for the same term? Provide the mnemonic and term for each. Note this occurs in courses with multiple sections.

GROUP BY c.course_id, c.term_id
HAVING COUNT(t.instructor_ID) > 1

--10b For courses with multiple sections, provide the term, course mnemonic, and instructor name for each. Hint: You can use your result from 10a in a subquery or WITH clause.
